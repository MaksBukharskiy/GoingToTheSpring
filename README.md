# GoingToTheSpring 🚀

This repository is a personal learning workspace focused on **Java backend development** with a strong emphasis on **Spring Framework and Spring Boot**.

It contains multiple small, independent examples and exercises created while learning and practicing core backend concepts — from basic Java and algorithms to Spring Core, AOP, and Spring Data JPA.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a solid foundation in Java
- Practice algorithmic problems commonly asked in interviews
- Understand Spring Core concepts deeply (IoC, DI, Beans, AOP)
- Move step by step toward production-level Spring Boot applications

---

## 📚 What’s inside

- **Java & Algorithms**
  - HashMap-based problems
